# SnowCholera
Data and code for analyzing John Snow's "South London" cholera data

See my John Snow Project website: http://www.hilerun.org/econ/papers/snow for more detailed explanation of data and scripts

Working paper with discussion of Snow, the data, and the statistics, on SSRN (long, roughly 90 pages): https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3262234

These are RStudio notebooks, each with explanation and code. The notebook (.Rmd) can be run in RStudio. For each notebook there is an associated html sheet (.nb.html) which should be a self-contained web page that displays the results.

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and independent (in terms of code) from the others. The order for looking at and running these notebooks is:

1. Snow1855_read1
2. Snow1855_SimpleDiD_QRCT
3. Snow1855_DiDRegression1
4. Snow1855_DidRegression2_ErrorAnalysis
5. Snow1856_TableVI_Intro
6. Snow1856_TableVI_DiD
