#### Creating the Data

We must stack the data from Snow 1855 Tables VIII and XII and create appropriate indicator variables. Here we also need to merge in the population estimates from Snow 1856 Tables I & II. 

Note a small but important issue: Snow's 1856 Table VI updates the 1854 deaths by subdistrict slightly relative to 1855 Table XII - 1856 Table VI covers 17 weeks from 8 July 1854 to 4 November 1854, while Table XII covers 15 weeks (ending 21 October 1854). The analysis here uses the 15-week (1855 Table XII) death counts. The alternative would be to use the 1856 Table VI numbers in all analysis, or the 1855 Table XII for the single & "two Lambeth" analysis (the 1855 anlaysis) and the 1856 Table VI update for the fractional (proportional) effect analysis.

Note the following important adjustments to the by-supplier population from 1856 Table VI:


1) Adjusting up subdistrict population by supplier to match the district-level sums
  + The sum of subdistricts from Tables I, II, III, and VI (to the district level) is less than the reported district population from Table V
  + I simply adjust up each subdistrict by the ratio of (district reported / district summed from subdistricts)
  + This applies the same adjustment within each district x Supplier pair (9 districts and two suppliers) 
2) Zeroing Lambeth population for "First 12" Southwark-only subdistricts
3) Adjusting downwards the Southwark & Vauxhall and Lambeth populations if combined is greater than 1851 population
  + Take the by-supplier population after adjustments (1) and (2), sum to a "Combined"
  + If this "Combined" is greater than 1851 population, adjust down each of Southwark & Vauxhal and Lambeth by the ratio of (Combined / Pop 1851)
4) Calculate "other" as residual of "Pop1851" less "Combined"

The relevant sections from Snow's 1856 (pp 245-246) are 

> the subdistricts of St. Saviour's, Southwark, Leather Market, Bermondsey, Battersea, and Peckham, have been represented to contain a few houses supplied by the Lambeth Company, although they do not contain any.

> The numbers which are stated to represent the houses supplied by each water company in each subdistrict are found on adding up the tables not to do so, but to represent the number of houses, minus those situated in streets in which no death occurred; the latter being placed all together at the end of each group of subdistricts which constitutes a district. \ldots The number of houses in these exempted streets is about one-ninth of the whole.

Code to sum up populations by regions for the different adjustments to population (BUT only for the 28 subdistricts "First 12" and "Next 16"):

+ Adjustment (0), No adjustments (directly from 1856 Table VI)
+ Adjustment (1), upwards so subdistrict sums (from Table VI) match district reports (Table V)
+ Adjustment (2), zeroing Lambeth population in Vauxhall-only subdistricts
+ Adjustment (3), adjusting down by-supplier population if combined greater than 1851
